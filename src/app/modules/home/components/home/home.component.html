                The World of Diamond is a comic-manga. The story is taking place in between two universes, competing with
                each other. This piece of work is created and designed by Micha≈Ç Piechulek. It was an independent art
                project to improving artistic skills. Created in 2009-2010, it grew up to 132 pages of hand drawn
                comic. The story plot is a little chaotic and crazy but, I hope You will enjoi it.
