                The story is takeing place, between two bordering each other universes. The world of diamond and hell.
                The diamond world is a kind of barrier, to the next circle of hell to be absorbed, fighting for surviving
                of the whole eternity. Hell for the other hand is a massive black hole, that has absorbed it's own whole
                universes.
                Demons, always are  hungry for energy, try to get to other worlds to consume them, and achieve greater power.
                But they can't get it without achieving political order, by that culminating enough energy to brake the
                barriers of two universes.On the other hand, the messengers of the diamond world have legendary items crafted from black matter, thanks to them they manage to fight off the attacks of hellish creatures, but for how long ...

                The world of diamonds is one of the last planets in a dying universe. With different biomasses and
                scenery. Creatures that inhabit it, are of all origins. The most important are the diamond carriers,
                beings synchronized with mighty artifacts, giving them power.
                The hellish world, on the other hand, is a black hole, and the creatures that live there are neither
                dead nor alive. they are shells run by neutron stars energy. Should they ever get out, they will destroy
                the next universe with their unstoppable energy hunger.

                All the characters are invented by Me. When i was sketching some random stuff, every time a cookie character appeared in my mind. One after another like chain. And with them the story plot stared to grow. The comic is based on a manga artistic style. Therefore the colorists of the comic is black and white. THe character are evolving prom chapter to chapter by drawing style and overall creation. With every page a gained some new skill and technics of drawing soo there are some differences in style.
