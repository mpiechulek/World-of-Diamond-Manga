# MyComic

The World of Diamond is a manga-style comic, created and designed by Micha≈Ç Piechulek. It was an independent art project aiming to improve his artistic skills. Created in 2009-2010, it grew to 132 pages of hand drawn comic. The story takes place in between two competing universes. The plot is a little chaotic and crazy, but I hope you will enjoy it.
